  Overall architecture of the Science Mesh and how those components are implemented

architecture of the system on conceptual level.

There is a [Central Component](central-component-architecture) that handles
metadata of the Science Mesh together with monitoring and accounting. In
addition to the conceptual architecture, we also describe how the [Central
Component is implemented](central-component-implementation).
