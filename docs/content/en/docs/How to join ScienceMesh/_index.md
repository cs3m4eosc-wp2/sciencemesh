---

To join the ScienceMesh, there are several formal and technical steps. If you encounter any problems during this process or have some general questions, feel free to contact the ScienceMesh administration here (FIXME).

### Steps to join the ScienceMesh (FIXME)
Here is a brief overview of the steps necessary to join the ScienceMesh project:

1. Read the technical and legal documentation which can be found here (FIXME).
1. Get into contact with the ScienceMesh administration by using this online form (FIXME).
1. After reviewing your request, an administrator will get back to you, detailing the next steps; these include:
    - Getting remaining details about your site, especially technical ones like your IOP address for health monitoring
    - Performing initial compatibility and quality tests
    - FIXME...
1. Once all prerequisites have been met, you need to agree to and sign our OLAs/SLAs (FIXME).
1. Your site is added to our central database, effectively integrating it into the ScienceMesh.
    - This includes appearing on all mesh dashboards and being actively monitored for proper health.
1. In order to maintain your site's information, you will need to create an administrative account for our central database and request proper accesss rights.
    - More information will be provided by an administrator after your site has joined the mesh.
