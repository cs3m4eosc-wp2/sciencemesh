# Disclaimer (January 2022)

Kindly note that the documents presented here have not been formally
confirmed by representatives of the Sites yet, those are just drafts
discussed extensively within the community expected to form the
infrastructure.

In addition, you may note that the establishing documents work with the
idea that membership will be available completely free of charge. As
approach to financing for infrastructures like the ScienceMesh in EOSC is
under discussions and developments, it must be stated that it may not be
the case and it may be necessary to form a consortium as a legal entity and
also requiring a membership fee. Central part of the infrastructure is
nevertheless intentionally designed to be minimal, so that costs of its
operations are kept as low as possible. And of course, if another financing
source is found, membership fees could go even lower.

The infrastructure is about to be formally established in the middle of
2022.

# Governance Structure of the Science Mesh

Governance structure of the Science Mesh is based on following bodies:
- Science Mesh Executive Board ratifying important decisions,
- Science Mesh Steering Group consisting of representatives of sites (each
  site should nominate a representative), discussing and voting on rules
  and significant technical decisions,
- Operations Team operating central components of the Science Mesh,
  processing adding sites and services, and providing assistence to the
  sites. The Operations Team is also the point of contact to apply for
  Science Mesh membership.

# Establishing Documents

Sites apply for membership by signing a Site Declaration. The Declaration
is purposefully kept as brief as possible and limited just to basic
principles of the infrastructure. It refers to the Science Mesh Policy
Framework Constitution, where governance structure is defined as well as
general outlines of standard operational procedures and requirements for
the sites.

While those documents will surely be examined by law departments of joining
sites, we should point out that section 3.1 of the Science Mesh Policy
Constitution summarises requirements for membership, among others listing
several Terms and Conditions and policies the sites are required to have in
place.
