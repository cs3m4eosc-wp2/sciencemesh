### Disclaimer (January 2022)

Kindly note that the documents presented here have not been formally
confirmed by representatives of the Sites yet, those are just drafts
discussed extensively within the community expected to form the
infrastructure.

In addition, you may note that the establishing documents work with the
idea that membership will be available completely free of charge. As
approach to financing for infrastructures like the ScienceMesh in EOSC is
under discussions and developments, it must be stated that it may not be
the case and it may be necessary to form a consortium as a legal entity and
also requiring a membership fee. Central part of the infrastructure is
nevertheless intentionally designed to be minimal, so that costs of its
operations are kept as low as possible. And of course, if another financing
source is found, membership fees could go even lower.

The infrastructure is about to be formally established in the middle of
2022.
