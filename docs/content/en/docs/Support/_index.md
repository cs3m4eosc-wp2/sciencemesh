## Support

A description of how support in the Science Mesh is organised is described 
in detail in [Science Mesh Support Procedure](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5040027). 
It describes how support for both users as well as service providers is going to be organised within the 
Science Mesh. There is a formal support process with a helpdesk as well as an informal community-based channel.

It is expected that service providers handle incoming issues and requests from 
their own users in their own helpdesk system. 
A central Science Mesh helpdesk will be there for service provider admins only. 
Currently, the central Science Mesh helpdesk is still work in progress but there is an informal support Gitter channel at [https://gitter.im/sciencemesh/community](https://gitter.im/sciencemesh/community).
This Gitter channel allows admins to ask questions and discuss issues and possible solutions. 
We recommend you to subscribe to this channel.
