  A short description of Science Mesh support
---

It is necessary to distinguish between support for users of the sites and
operators of the sites in the Science Mesh. First and foremost, site users
are supported by their sites to make support structure scalable. Whenever
interaction between sites is necessary to solve a technical issue, it
should be handled by the support of the site of the user having the issue.
It is expected that service providers handle incoming issues and requests from 
their own users in their own helpdesk systems. 

Central Science Mesh helpdesk will be established for service provider
admins only. There will be a formal support process including helpdesk with
a proper ticketing system.

Currently, the central Science Mesh helpdesk is still work in progress but there is an informal support Gitter channel at [https://gitter.im/sciencemesh/community](https://gitter.im/sciencemesh/community).
This Gitter channel allows admins to ask questions and discuss issues and possible solutions. 
We recommend site administrators to subscribe to this channel.

Having both formal and informal means of providing support is expected to
be retained into operation.

Formalised description of support operation is available as the [Science Mesh Support Procedure](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5040027).
