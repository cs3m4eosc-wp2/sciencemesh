    Configuring support for the invitation workflow in Nextcloud and

Both Nextcloud and ownCloud 10 are covered by a procedure described in
https://sciencemesh-nextcloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html.

There are some caveats in the process one should be aware of, though.

- which version of ownCloud/Nextcloud to use

- which is the correct version of the application that really works

- necessary changes in helm charts

- Nextcloud vs. ownCloud 10 specifics

- tricky bits in toml files?

- check ingress rules?

- any meaningful procedure for testing?


Changes of the docs necessary elsewhere (possibly):

- is this page https://developer.sciencemesh.io/docs/technical-documentation/integrations/nextcloud/ completely obsolete? 

- Reva deployment and Helm charts?
