To join ScienceMesh you need to set up EFSS instance, as stated in the **[How to join ScienceMesh]({{< ref "How to join ScienceMesh2" >}})**.

Then you need to set up **[Reva IOP (interoperability platform)]({{< ref "docs/Technical-documentation/IOP" >}})** and [configure it]({{< ref "docs/Technical-documentation/IOP/configuration" >}}). 

Then you can continue with the **[Central Database]({{< ref "docs/Technical-documentation/central-database" >}})** and **[Monitoring and Accounting]({{< ref "docs/Technical-documentation/monitoring" >}})** sections as follows.
