This is the technical documentation of the ScienceMesh infrastructure. It
describes how to join the infrastructure and how it operates, as well as
how the infrastructure is organised.

To get **basic ideas** about how the Science Mesh operates, we recommend you to start reading the [Overview]({{< ref "docs/Overview" >}}), and it may also help your understanding to at least skim through the [Architecture]({{< ref "docs/Architecture" >}}).

If you are a **site adminstrator wishing to join the Science Mesh**
infrastructure, and you have basic understanding of the architecture of the
federation, follow the [How to join Science
Mesh](how-to-join-sciencemesh) guide--the main checklist of steps necessary
to join the infrastructure that will guide you through the configuration
and direct you to particular technical howtos.

If you are a user of a site, this documentation is **not** for you. When
seeking help, contact your standard helpdesk who will be able to give you
assistance with using the Science Mesh as well.

If you find an error or you want to contribute to the documentation go to [Contribution Guidelines]({{< ref "docs/Contribution Guidelines" >}}).
